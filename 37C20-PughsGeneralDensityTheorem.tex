\begin{document}
Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. There is a residual subset of $\Diff^1(M)$ in which every element $f$ satisfies $\overline{\Per(f)}= \Omega(f)$.
In other words: Generically, the set of periodic points of a $\Cdiff^1$ diffeomorphism is dense in its nonwandering set.

Here, $\Diff^1(M)$ denotes the set of all $\Cdiff^1$ difeomorphisms from $M$ to 
itself, endowed with the (strong) $\Cdiff^1$ topology.
