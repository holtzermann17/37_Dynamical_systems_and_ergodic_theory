\begin{thm}[Frobenius]
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold ($C^\infty$) and let $\Delta$ be a
distribution on $M$.  Then $\Delta$ is completely integrable if and only if
$\Delta$ is involutive.
\end{thm}

One direction in the proof is pretty easy since the tangent space
of an integral manifold is involutive, so sometimes the theorem is only
stated in one direction, that is:  If $\Delta$ is involutive then it is
completely integrable.

Another way to \PMlinkescapetext{state} the theorem is that if we have $n$ vector fields $\{X_k\}_{k=1}^n$ on a manifold $M$ such that they are linearly independent at every point of the manifold, and furthermore if for any $k,m$ we have
$[X_k,X_m] = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j X_j$ for some $C^\infty$ functions $a_j$, then for any point $x \in N$, there exists a germ of a submanifold $N \subset M$, through  $x$, such that $TN$ is spanned
by $\{X_k\}_{k=1}^n$.  Note that if we extend $N$ to all of $M$, it need not be
an embedded submanifold anymore, but just an immersed one.

For $n=1$ above, this is just the existence and uniqueness of solution of ordinary differential equations.
